Mission Statement
As a student or teacher attending at Penn State Abington, there is no way to check what is currently in the cafeteria. Penn States food services http://menu.hfs.psu.edu/ does not include Penn State Abington. So our team plans to develop a mobile application that allows for users to see what is in the cafeteria, order food to be prepped ahead of time and providing convenience to those attending Penn State Abington.

Executive Summary
Food is a necessity in life and it is what keeps our body functioning. Many students, including our team do not eat breakfast before we head to school. Therefore, we usually get food at the school's cafeteria. But, if you're a student who has classes back to back, you have about 10 minutes to head to the cafeteria, figure out what you want to eat, wait in line to pay, and then eat. With about 10 minutes to do all that,  you can guarntee you are going to be late to class. But what if there isn't any food that you like currently out at the cafeteria, and if you dont eat then its harder for you to focus in class. 

Our team goal with the Penn State Cafe mobile application is to fix this problem. We will create a mobile application with the basic functionalities like seeing daily menus, specials of the day, soups of the day, custom ordering with comments, paying on the go, and nutritional values. We hope to help those with limited time in between classes and are hungry to order on the go! 

Stakeholders
This project involves three major groups of stakeholders. The first group consists of our development team, tasked with setting forth requirements, specifications and developing and testing the application. Our client is Professor Soby Chacko, who will be avaiable to assist us if we run into any roadblocks during our devlopment process. We will be providing him with weeky updates on our progress. We will take his suggestion and make any changes that will be neccessary for our project. We will deliver our application to him at the end of the semester. The thrid and final group of stakeholders are our target userrs. Our goal is to create a user friendly food ordering application that users at Penn State Abington can quickly order food and pay without waiting in line.
